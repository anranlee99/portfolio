                My name is Aaron Lee. I am a CS student at UC Santa Cruz
                My programming roots are in C++ but in the recent years, 
                I have been using Python and Node.js more. I am passionate
                about all things nerdy! Check out my links to see my work besides
                this site and feel to contact about any work/collab opportunities. 
                Have a great day!
